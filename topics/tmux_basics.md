# TMUX Basics

tmux, or 'Terminal Multiplexer', is a very useful tool for using the command line. It has many, many tools, but the most important feature for starting out is that you can use it to run programs in the background while you are logged off. That is, you can start a long job, then log out of the server and go home, and tmux will keep the job running. Most of you are familiar with the program *screen* to accomplish this, but tmux is much more powerful. Below are a few commands to get you started. Once you are used to using it you can begin to explore more options. In the future we will try to keep this page updated with additional tips and tricks, but for now, here is one (of many) cheat sheets available online:

## Starting and detaching from a session

### New Session

To start an unnamed session, you can just enter the name of the program at the prompt:

```
$ tmux
```

I suggest you give a session a name when you start it, which will make it easier to keep track once you have multiple sessions going:

```
$ tmux new -s name_of_session
```

### Detach from a Session
