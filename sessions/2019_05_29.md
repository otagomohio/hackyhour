# Visualising Alignments and Assemblies--from SAM files to SeqMonk

## The SAM/BAM file format

The Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) file format is the standard format for storing output from mapping next-generation sequence reads to a genome, transcriptome, or other reference. They are most often in the compressed version, called BAM (binary alignment map), because their size can be very large. These files store a lot of information about each read, as it relates to the reference. 

**[This link has a good basic description](http://www.metagenomics.wiki/tools/samtools/bam-sam-file-format)**

Details of all standard and optional fields are found in this **[PDF](http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf)**

There are two main components of a SAM file: the first part is the header section, which can include information about the file parameters ('@HD', e.g. format, and sorting order of reads), the reference sequences ('@SQ', sequence name and length) and the sample, or Read Group ('@RQ', e.g. ID, barcode, platform). SAM files can vary a lot, and not all of them will have every field. There are only a few fields required for each. See the PDF link for minimal requirements. 

The most useful information in a SAM file is in the alignment section, which has 11 mandatory fields and many many optional fields (you can even add your own fields). This section is essentially a giant table (tab-delimited), with each field as column and each read is a row. 

QNAME | FLAG | RNAME | POS | MAPQ | CIGAR | RNEXT | PNEXT | TLEN | SEQ | QUAL |
------|------|-------|-----|------|-------|-------|-------|------|-----|------|
query name | code | reference | ref start | mapping qual | indel info | mate | mate pos | template length | sequence | sequence quality |
