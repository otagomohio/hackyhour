# Visualising Alignments and Assemblies--from SAM files to SeqMonk

## The SAM/BAM file format

The Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) file format is the standard format for storing output from mapping next-generation sequence reads to a genome, transcriptome, or other reference. They are most often in the compressed version, called BAM (binary alignment map), because their size can be very large. These files store a lot of information about each read, as it relates to the reference.
