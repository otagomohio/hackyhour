# Working with others on the server

The Linux operating system was designed for multiple users, which makes it ideal for a server environment, and allows you to share your scripts and files with your colleagues. Here are some links and quick tips to getting your work going and letting others access your files. 

### Quick tip: getting your script running

Once you have written your script, in order to run it you have to make it *executable*. This is accomplished with one simple command:

```
chmod a+x
```

To break down the above command: `chmod` means 'change mode', and is the main command to change permissions. The `a` refers to all: that you are giving permission for anyone to use this script; the `+` is to add a permission, and the `x` is to make the file executable. 

For a full explanation of all the permission symbols, see [**this link**](https://www.howtogeek.com/437958/how-to-use-the-chmod-command-on-linux/)

### Making your script available system wide

Once you have your script, you can make it available so the computer can find it anywhere on the system. If you are submitting a job (slurm) script on NeSI, you can add something like the following to the slurm script:

```
export PATH='/nesi/project/uoo5555555/scripts/':$PATH
```

The script should be able to then find the script and run it (don't forget to make it executable). 

#### Symbolic links

If you have a folder that is already in the Path (e.g. /usr/local/bin), you can add a [**symbolic link**](https://www.shellhacks.com/symlink-create-symbolic-link-linux/) that adds the script to the existing path:

```
ln -s /path/to/dir /path/to/symlink
```
