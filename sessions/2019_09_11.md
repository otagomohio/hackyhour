# Shell Scripting

Once you move beyond basic shell commands, and the process becomes increasingly complicated, you are going to want the commands into a shell script. There are many good tutorials online to get you started. The [**Software Carpentry website**](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) includes some good tips on their [**Unix Shell lesson**](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) (chapters 5 and 6). As well, [**Data Carpentry**](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/) has a good introduction on their lesson: [**Introduction to the Command Line for Genomics**](https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/). For the lesson here, we will take you through some basics to get you started.

## Simple script

In a text editor, add the following:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# a first script

echo 'Hello World'

```
