# Shell Scripting

Once you move beyond basic shell commands, and the process becomes increasingly complicated, you are going to want the commands into a shell script. There are many good tutorials online to get you started. The [**Software Carpentry website**](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) includes some good tips on their [**Unix Shell lesson**](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) (chapters 5 and 6). As well, [**Data Carpentry**](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/) has a good introduction on their lesson: [**Introduction to the Command Line for Genomics**](https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/). For the lesson here, we will take you through some basics to get you started.

## Simple script

In a text editor, add the following:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# a first script

echo 'Hello World'

```

The first line is called the *Shebang*, which tells the script where the BASH interpreter is. It is possible to run without this line, but your script may not work in all environments (see [**Here**](https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/) and [**Here**](https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Shebang) for more details than you would ever want to know). The next line that starts with the `#` is a comment, and is ignored by BASH, but can help tell the reader what is going on in the script. The last line just has the command to output "Hello World" to the screen. 

## A little less simple: running other programs

The following script *fastq2fasta.sh* will convert one of our example fastq files to a fasta format

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# running another program with the shell: seqtk 

# This command will convert the fastq file to a fasta file


seqtk seq -A example_data/e4485061.924a.4f09.9d7e.bfefc780d1a8_11_L001_R1_001.fastq > example_data/sample1.fasta

```

## Repeating the same command: Looping

The above script works fine if we want to just do one file (but then you would hardly need a script for one command for one file), but if we want to do the same command on multiple files, we can set up a for loop:

**Shell script: *fastq2fasta_loop.sh***

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# running another program with the shell: seqtk 

# This command will convert multiple fastq files to the fasta format

cd example_data

for fq in *.fastq
do
	seqtk seq -A $fq > $fq\.fasta

done

```

The `\` in the command is called an *escape*. That is so the program doesn't confuse what variable you are calling.
