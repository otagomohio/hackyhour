# Getting help and contributing to Hacky Hour

We would like to increase communication among the group. Of course, you are always free to bring your issues and questions to Hacky Hour, but problems occur at random, often inconvenient times. Therefore we are exploring ways for you to post issues to us, and provide a flexible way for everyone to comment. Some suggested options I have heard include: [**Slack**](https://slack.com/intl/en-nz/), Wikis, [**GitHub**](https://github.com/), and even Twitter. We can discuss all of these, but for this session we start with GitHub.

## Posting issues on a GitHub repository

To post an issue on any GitHub repo, you will need a GitHub account. Once you have that, go to this link:

[**Hacky Hour Issues**](https://github.com/otagomohio/hackyhour/issues)

It is always good practice to check the existing issues (even closed issues) to see if your problem has been addressed. 

If you find a post that is relevant, you just click on it, and you can add your own comment to the bottom. You can paste in snippets of code, or add files and links. The comment box is Markdown-compatible, so you can format your text with markdown. 

If you want to be notified about any changes to this issue, click on Notifications box to the right

If there is no relevant issue, then you can start a new issue, just click on the green box labeled **New issue**. You will then receive an email when anyone responds on this post. 

## You can also post and search issues on Google Groups pages
