# Whatâ€™s going on: checking the status of projects and jobs on NeSI (and other places)

It can be important to keep track of what you are doing on the server. How many CPUs you have used, how many you have left. How much disk space is left on your project, or your home folder. Here are a few commands to help you keep track, along with links to more information on NeSI.

## CPU usage

There is a command for NeSI to track how many core hours you have used over the course of each project. Note, that this is not just the number of hours a job runs, but the time is multiplied by the number of CPUs used for that job. The amount of working memory (RAM) may also be figured in that calculation. To keep it straight, use the following command:

In this example, we are looking at logical CPU core use for the project *nesi00420*

```
nn_corehour_usage -l nesi00420
```

To view the Fair Share adjusted CPU core use (see [**this link**]() for details on Fair Share and [**here**]() for job prioritisation), use `-f` instead of `-l`

```
nn_corehour_usage -f nesi00420
```

And to see only two months of usage use the -n option

```
nn_corehour_usage -l nesi00420 -n 2
```
